Thanks to them, it will not be possible to get bored on the server, knowing only one mod and developing only in it, since most of the craft were complicated. Unlike the original FTB project, we made assembly a little easier by removing a number of decorative and duplicating mods so that as many players as possible could play on our servers.",
